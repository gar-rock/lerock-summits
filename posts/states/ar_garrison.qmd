Mount Magazine Signal Hill is located within the Ozark Mountains of Western Arkansas. Elevation 2,753ft.
It is highly accessible via car, with a short 5 minutes walk to the top. 
The summit is well maintained and has one of my favorite high pointers club benches with lots of stickers. 

This is a high point that many of us have done multiple times. It's a great introduction what some of the easier high points look like, while also offering some natural Arkansas beauty.
