Well High Point fans, many of you know Adam Dunn and I have  been pursuing our goal of visiting the highest elevation of all 50 states over the past 47 months.  On Thursday June 3rd we came within 250 feet of completing that goal when one of our climbing team partners died just short of the summit of Denali, Alaska (our last state), which necessitated the end of the climb for the entire team of 9 climbers and 3 guides.
Despite being less than the length of a football field away from the goal, I would still like to dedicate this 16 day climb to John Hogg (left), former Scout Executive for Santa Fe Trail Council, who tragically died before completing all 50 states himself, but who planted the seed of enthusiasm for this quest within me 15 years ago.  I would also like to dedicate this climb to Fernando Birman (right), our mountaineering team member who died on this Denali expedition.
I had many things planned to say upon our successful completion of this 50th state High Point, including a momentary renaming of Denali back to "Mt. McKinley", as a favor to lifelong friend Bruce Slimmer, whose great, great uncle was actually William McKinley.  However, life doesn't always turn out the way you expect it.  I want to say how much we appreciate all the prayers, well wishes, and support so many of you have given over the last 47 months.  It is truly treasured.  Please say a prayer for the wife and family of Fernando Birman, as they could use that support right now as well.  As for Adam and I, we will just have to be content with 49.99 state High Points completed (for now...)
