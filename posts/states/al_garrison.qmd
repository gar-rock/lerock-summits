The Alabama hp is called Cheaha Mountain.
It is located in the Eastern part of the state within the Cheaha State Park. At the top of this hp is a stone lodge and lookout tower. 

This hp was part of the Dixie Loop that covers 6 state hps in the southern US. During this trip we drove for 3 days covering the high points of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, and Missouri.
