It is through our experience that Granite Peak should be revered. This mountain should be considered not only as a strenuous hike, but also a 5.0 climb. I would recommend climbing gear if you are unfamiliar with actual rock climbing... and I do not mean your typical Colorado 14er scramble.
Signaling to the seriousness of this route, there are portions of this hike with ominous names such as "Froze-To-Death Plateau" (which for us was more like Sunburnt-To-A-Scrisp Plateau) and "The Switchbacks from Hell".

There are multiple sections of this mountain that require ropes for climbing or rapelling. 
There are at least 2 rapelling/climbing sections (one right at the summit) and one snow bridge traverse.

For us, in the early fall of 2020 this summit proved to be a somber one. A member of a sister crew that summitted that day perished from an 800' fall at the top of the peak. He was the climbing leader of that crew, and was setting up a rapell station for his group when the boulder that he was on gave way. During the accident his brother had his legs crushed from fallen rock. Their father stranded on the top without a safe route down had to find a way to his son. After the accident we assisted in the only way we could, by providing water and food for them to use until the helicoper evac crew could extract them from the 12,000ft ledge that they were stranded on (evac wither that night or the next morning).

Meanwhile on the way back down, my father had injured his arm at 12,500ft while rapelling on our first section. When this happended we had just started our descent at around 5pm, well before raching the 40ft long snow-bridge traverse... For those of you familar with mountain climbing, you might recall that it is a big mistake to be on the summit anywhere near this time of day. In our retrospection we should have turned around earlier in the day (maybe around the snow-bridge), realizing that we had not allowed enough time to summit and get back to our campsite safely in the same day. 

Because of this late start on our descent we had to bivvy at around 11,000ft on Granite Peak... and by bivvy I mean put on all of the clothes that we had, and slip into our packpacking packs as best we could. That night it had gotten down to 45 degrees at that elevation with a light wind. We only slept during short moments of exahustion and suppressed disbelief.

Around 4:30am the sun started to hit the horizon, enabling us to see the ground after that dark night, and so we continued our descent. 
At the high camp we were recieved by another group of friends we had made the day prior who had hot water and granola bars in hand. We were met with warm smiles and a rising sun. This moment was likely the most relieved I've ever felt in my life, knowing that the worst was behind us and that we o1nly had 12 miles to the car. After trekking back through Sunburnt-To-A-Scrisp Plateau and the beautiful Mystic Lake our spirits were up. 

This trip was a test of our mental fortitude under extreme duress and sadness. We grew in ways that we were not prepared for, and it helps to write about this experience even to this day.
