    "text": "It is through our experience that Granite Peak should be revered. This mountain should be considered not only as a strenuous hike, but also a 5.0 climb. I would recommend climbing gear if you are unfamiliar with actual rock climbing… and I do not mean your typical Colorado 14er scramble. Signaling to the seriousness of this route, there are portions of this hike with ominous names such as “Froze-To-Death Plateau” (which for us was more like Sunburnt-To-A-Scrisp Plateau) and “The Switchbacks from Hell”.\nThere are multiple sections of this mountain that require ropes for climbing or rapelling. There are at least 2 rapelling/climbing sections (one right at the summit) and one snow bridge traverse.\nFor us, in the early fall of 2020 this summit proved to be a somber one. A member of a sister crew that summitted that day perished from an 800’ fall at the top of the peak. He was the climbing leader of that crew, and was setting up a rapell station for his group when the boulder that he was on gave way. During the accident his brother had his legs crushed from fallen rock. Their father stranded on the top without a safe route down had to find a way to his son. After the accident we assisted in the only way we could, by providing water and food for them to use until the helicoper evac crew could extract them from the 12,000ft ledge that they were stranded on (evac wither that night or the next morning).\nMeanwhile on the way back down, my father had injured his arm at 12,500ft while rapelling on our first section. When this happended we had just started our descent at around 5pm, well before raching the 40ft long snow-bridge traverse… For those of you familar with mountain climbing, you might recall that it is a big mistake to be on the summit anywhere near this time of day. In our retrospection we should have turned around earlier in the day (maybe around the snow-bridge), realizing that we had not allowed enough time to summit and get back to our campsite safely in the same day.\nBecause of this late start on our descent we had to bivvy at around 11,000ft on Granite Peak… and by bivvy I mean put on all of the clothes that we had, and slip into our packpacking packs as best we could. That night it had gotten down to 45 degrees at that elevation with a light wind. We only slept during short moments of exahustion and suppressed disbelief.\nAround 4:30am the sun started to hit the horizon, enabling us to see the ground after that dark night, and so we continued our descent. At the high camp we were recieved by another group of friends we had made the day prior who had hot water and granola bars in hand. We were met with warm smiles and a rising sun. This moment was likely the most relieved I’ve ever felt in my life, knowing that the worst was behind us and that we o1nly had 12 miles to the car. After trekking back through Sunburnt-To-A-Scrisp Plateau and the beautiful Mystic Lake our spirits were up.\nThis trip was a test of our mental fortitude under extreme duress and sadness. We grew in ways that we were not prepared for, and it helps to write about this experience even to this day.\nNews Article of the event `"

    "text": "Mount Magazine Signal Hill is located within the Ozark Mountains of Western Arkansas. Elevation 2,753ft. It is highly accessible via car, with a short 5 minutes walk to the top. The summit is well maintained and has one of my favorite high pointers club benches with lots of stickers.\nThis is a high point that many of us have done multiple times. It’s a great introduction what some of the easier high points look like, while also offering some natural Arkansas beauty."

    "text": "The Arizona high point is situated just north of the beautiful town of Flagstaff. This makes for an excellent launching point, as the peak can be summitted within a 10 mile round trip hike, reaching an elevation of 12,633ft. The trailhead is about 20miles (35 minutes) from Pulliam airport.\nIt is located in the Eastern part of the state within the Cheaha State Park. At the top of this hp is a stone lodge and lookout tower.\nThis is a moderately strenuous hike that typically takes 4.5 hours. There are multiple false summits towards the top with large boulders and scramling required. Once you reach the summit you will be greeted with a magnificent view of the surrounding Arizona desert. My favorite aspect of this view was seeing the Grand Canyon way out on the Northern horizon.\nThis is another comment"

    "text": "Well High Point fans, many of you know Adam Dunn and I have been pursuing our goal of visiting the highest elevation of all 50 states over the past 47 months. On Thursday June 3rd we came within 250 feet of completing that goal when one of our climbing team partners died just short of the summit of Denali, Alaska (our last state), which necessitated the end of the climb for the entire team of 9 climbers and 3 guides. Despite being less than the length of a football field away from the goal, I would still like to dedicate this 16 day climb to John Hogg (left), former Scout Executive for Santa Fe Trail Council, who tragically died before completing all 50 states himself, but who planted the seed of enthusiasm for this quest within me 15 years ago. I would also like to dedicate this climb to Fernando Birman (right), our mountaineering team member who died on this Denali expedition. I had many things planned to say upon our successful completion of this 50th state High Point, including a momentary renaming of Denali back to “Mt. McKinley”, as a favor to lifelong friend Bruce Slimmer, whose great, great uncle was actually William McKinley. However, life doesn’t always turn out the way you expect it. I want to say how much we appreciate all the prayers, well wishes, and support so many of you have given over the last 47 months. It is truly treasured. Please say a prayer for the wife and family of Fernando Birman, as they could use that support right now as well. As for Adam and I, we will just have to be content with 49.99 state High Points completed (for now…)\nthis is an update another"
